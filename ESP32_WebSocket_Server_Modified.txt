This sketch creates a websocket on the ESP32 server to control a garage door over WiFi.
A N.O. switch is required to determine the open and closed positions of the door.
The output requires dry contacts to connect across the pushbutton that operates the door.
The sketch was used on an ESP32-DevKitC V2 module.
Several libraries will be required to be added to the arduino environment fot the sketch to work.
